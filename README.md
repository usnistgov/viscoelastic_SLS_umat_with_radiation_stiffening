# Viscoelastic Standard Linear Solid User Material with Thermal and Radiation Dose Effects


## Purpose
This repository contains code and calibration data for a linear viscoelastic (Standard Linear Solid rheological model) finite element user material that incorporates the effects of temperature and radiation dosage via empirical fitting to measured data.

The model is a research-grade code and while it should be relatively plug-and-play for those confortable with deploying finite element user materials in Claculix or Abaqus, is it not standalone software and requires operator skill to use successfully.
